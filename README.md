Why do we hate - A study to better understand the effects of income on hate crimes.

Background: The recent election cycle and resulting political turmoil has brought hate into the forefront of the American psyche. Racially motivated attacks lacking condemnation from a sitting United States president has caused us to revisit a question that many believed was put to rest decades ago. What's more surprising is that this is happening during a time where America is experiencing relatively unprecendented economic expansion. Unemployment is low, corporate profits are robust, however the vast majority of hourly workers have not shared in this prosperity. In an attempt to better understand this connection, we made a couple cool graphs. Enjoy!

Graph 1 - Graph one was Hate Crime Numbers per year. We used Plotly to show the change YOY from 2010 to 2017 in total hate crimes committed in the US. This graph shows that hate crime had a sharp increase in 2016 and 2017, which could be due to the political changes that occurred during that period.

Graph 2 - interactive geojson with per capita victim counts, candlestick to move from 2010 to 2017, mouseover map to
indicate crime rate at that given year. Start at state level, with option to zoom in to see city level data.

Graph 3 (required) - d3 interactive based (https://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/). Graph would timelapse through 2010-2017 (each state would be a bubble), with X axis would being each states per capita hate crime rate, Y axis would be the individual states per capita income, size of bubble could be the states total population.
